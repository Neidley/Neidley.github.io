## Explanation

This project taught me as a Bloc student how to do the following:

   * Bootstrap Angular to an application and create an Angular module   
   * Configure routing and states for an application   
   * Implement controllers for an application's views   
   * Create a service that controls song playback   
   * Write a custom directive that controls song and volume sliders   
   * Create a custom time code filter   

## Problem

I was tasked with utilizing Angular to refractor a previous version of the Bloc Jams application that I had built using JavaScript and jQuery.

Given 60 hours of time to complete the project, I needed to accomplish the following:

   * Bootstrap Angular to my application.   
   * Configure routing and states for my application.   
   * Implement controllers for my application's views.   
   * Create a service that handles song playback.   
   * Write a directive that controls song and volume sliders.   
   * Add a time code filter to display time properly.   

## Solution

*Angular's focus on Single Page Application (SPAs) using UI-Router made for a snappier user interface navigating between pages.*

## Results

 > *Taking the extra time to learn how to conceptualize the relationship between Angular's directives, controllers, and services through dependency injection by trial and error were invaluable to my Angular education...the skill of pushing myself to forage the internet outside the provided documentation to solve the problem at hand began here and that skill continues to help me forge ahead in my pursuit to be a competitive software developer.*

## Conclusion

What were your doubts going into the project?

   * *I was unsure what Angular could do in addition to what I had learned to accomplish using JavaScript and jQuery.*

What surprised you the most?

   * *Upon completion, I have a deep appreciation for Angular's benefits to  improve the user interface and it's potential to create powerful applications with minimal effort.*   

What would you have done differently?

   * *If I could go back, earlier in the project I wouldn't have stressed about fully comprehending the broader concepts, wrote down the questions I had at the time, and then continued with the next challenge and see if the answer came later on it's own.*   

What functionality (if any) would you like to add to this application in the future?

   * *Autoplay*   
   * *Mute the volume*   
   * *Account creation to manage music*   
   * *Profile Page*   
   * *Song/Album/Artist search*   
   * *Rating system*   
   * *Custom playlist creation*
