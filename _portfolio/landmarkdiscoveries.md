[Try Landmark Discoveries yourself!](https://landmark-discoveries.herokuapp.com/users/sign_up)

Landmark Discoveries allows users to tag landmarks and save them to their profile page.
The goal is to make as many discoveries and using the links provided learn more
about that landmark's history from Wikipedia. Users can also share their discoveries
through social media.

In the future, I hope to add additional functionality
such as adding friends and image comments
