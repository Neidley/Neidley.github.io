#### Explanation

Using Ruby-On-Rails, design my own Wikipedia-clone

#### Problem

Create, Read, Update, and Delete Users, Topics, Posts, and comments
Create and Delete for Upvoting/Downvoting

#### Solution

* _[Ruby-On-Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#what-s-next-questionmark) - Model, View, Controller (MVC) Framework for building a website built using the Ruby programming language._
* _[devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) - Authentication for Rails_

#### Conclusion

Ruby-on-Rails is now the first language I can say taught me to create a whole
website front to back thanks to Rail's Model, View, and Controller architecture.
Being able to directly interact with the database with the [Rails Console](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html) is particularly
useful to me as a developer.
