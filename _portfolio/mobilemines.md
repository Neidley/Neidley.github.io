## Explanation

[Check out the GitHub](https://github.com/Neidley/mobile-mines)

## Problem

[Check out my Medium article](https://medium.com/@neidz44/mobile-mines-open-source-click-game-built-on-react-d768783caa70)

## Results

> _I was worried how the open source community would receive me. Like most things,
> communication is key. Creating issues that would allow contributors to be creative
> and attract contributors was especially satisfying._

## Conclusion

What were your doubts going into the project?

* _Ridicule and looking stupid._

What surprised you the most?

* _How quickly people latched onto my ideas and were willing to volunteer their time._

What functionality (if any) would you like to add to this application in the future?

_Continue to work with fellow coders online to create more click-games that will
then be incorporated into a singular Arcade Cabinet React Component._
