#### Results

> _communication with open source is key. Creating issues that would allow contributors to be creative
> and attract contributors was especially gratifying._

#### Conclusion

Thoughts?

* _Asking concise questions and keeping issues simple helped attract contributors to the project_

What surprised you the most?

* _How quickly people latched onto my ideas and were willing to volunteer their time._

What functionality (if any) would you like to add to this application in the future?

_Continue to work with fellow coders online to create more click-games that will
then be incorporated into a singular Arcade Cabinet React Component._
