#### Explanation

Do the following:

* Register Firebase as a module in an Angular application.
* Inject the $firebaseArray service into a controller.
* Understand and use the Firebase JavaScript and AngularFire APIs - methods such as `child()` and `$add()`.
* Query a Firebase array.
* Use UI Bootstrap to create a modal.
* Use cookies to store information in the user's web browser.

#### Problem

Utilyze Angular, Firebase, AngularFire and UI Bootstrap to build a chat application.

Given 40 hours of time to complete the project, I accomplished the following:

* Display a list of available chat rooms.
* Implement a way to create a chat room.
* Allow each chat room to display a list of messages unique to that chat room.
* Implement a way to create a username
* Restrict access to users only.
* Associate messages to usernames.

#### Solution

_Firebase was a good introduction into backend programming, leaving me wanting to learn more. There is little setup required for new developers if you need a database._

#### Results

> _This project gave me much needed practice with Angular's directives, controllers, and services through dependency injection. With limited Firebase documentation, I reached out to my fellow Bloc Slack community of Software Development track students and mentors for assistance and foraged StackOverflow seeking answers._

#### Conclusion

What were your doubts going into the project?

* _I wasn't sure if I could navigate through and understand the documentation by myself. It was a good introduction to practice the foraging skills needed on a daily basis by developers to seek answers, which I took to heart._

What surprised you the most?

* _I was surprised by my retention of knowledge, considering the difficulty of the project._

What would you have done differently?

* _I feel that this project only scratches the surface of the capabilities of Firebase. I wish to spend more time practicing Firebase services._

What functionality (if any) would you like to add to this application in the future?

* _Create and authenticate accounts for my chat rooms using AngularFire's Authentication API_
* _Create admin users_
* _Allow admins to create private rooms for authorized participants_
* _Ability to see if another chat room participant is online_
* _Ability to see when another user is typing a message in my current chat room_
