title: Junior Software Engineer goals
---
My goals as a Engineer are threefold:

* Do work I can be proud of
* Continue to learn more about the world around me
* and help support the ones I love

I've always asked myself questions such as:

*How does technology help humanity traveled into further into Outer Space?
How does that work?
How could a language be comprised so as to solve everyday problems?
I've always been curious.*


After almost a year of learning software languages, JavaScript and Ruby, as well as their corresponding frameworks, AngularJS and Rails, I now ask myself:

*How do I use conditionals and loops to retrieve the data I need?
How do I write each step in pseudocode?
What are the questions I need to be asking myself?*


Everyday growing my career as a software developer excites me because I want to continue learning and finding answers.
