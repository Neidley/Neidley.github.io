title: My Goals as a Software Developer
---
My goals as a Software Developer are threefold:

* Support my family
* Express myself creatively
* Do work I can be proud of

My family consists of my wife, Rachel, and our two dogs, Bruno and Mary. We married on the beach in November 2016 and at the time I had what I thought was a stable job as an assistant store manager with AT&T Wireless. Shortly after the new year 2017 we got word from corporate ASM positions were in surplus status and we would find out at the end of the month if we were selected. Our store had been top performing in our market (consisting of 54 stores) Q3 and Q4 2016 on top of the fact our store was not above headcount so we thought we had nothing to worry about. Needless to say I found out later that month I had been selected and was given a choice to find another position within the company over the next 2 months or put in my two weeks and take a severance.

There was a period of panic and despair. What would we do? I never really enjoyed the responsibilities of being a manager in retail but the pay and benefits had been great. I wasn't willing to step down and continue to work retail, having done so for the previous 7 years, no time off during holidays and rare weekends off. I was determined to find a silver lining. My brother in law had mentioned his experience learning to code and was enthusiastic about the career opportunities. Long story short (too late) family has meant the world throughout this process. My mother-in-law let us move in with her to save money, my wife works so I can dedicate myself full-time to my studies to become a software developer, and my mom has helped us financially to afford the education and equipment needed to accomplish my goal. That goal is to ultimately land a job so I can support Rachel so she can go to school herself full-time and move to my home-state of Virginia.

Technology has always fascinated me as I've grown up. I've always wanted to study how things work. Learning to become a software developer excites me because I want to work on the front-lines of the ever growing technology spectrum. I've only just started this journey, but I dream of working with teams to develop clean energy technologies, app development, game development. What matters is challenging myself, finding the right size project and team that best suits my strengths and ultimately doing work I can be proud of. I want to help people better do the things they are passionate about, express themselves creatively, and open up new possibilities that have never been seen before.
