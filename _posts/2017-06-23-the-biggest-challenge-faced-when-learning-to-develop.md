title: The Biggest Challenge I've Faced when Learning to Develop
---
The biggest challenge I've faced when learning to develop has been being too hard on myself. There are three words of wisdom my Bloc mentor said to me that has helped me progress.

* Learning to code is very much like learning a new language. It takes time.
* Remember to take breaks.
* You will get stuck.

Early on my mentor, Tessa, recognized during our 1-on-1 sessions throughout each week that I was beating myself up when I didn't instantly understand a concept. She assured me she had no doubt I would understand if I kept at it. Tessa compared learning coding to learning a new language; that the brain has to form new neurological pathways to comprehend what it's seeing and that for everybody that takes time and practice. Learning by writing down questions as they came to me has become an indispensable skill throughout the process. Tessa stated as her years as a mentor she could categorize her students into two categories: overconfident in their abilities and underconfident in their abilities. I consider myself lucky to be one she considers underconfident in my abilities, and to have her tell me she believes I can become a great software developer meant I could tell myself that (when I start to pull my hair out when trying to solve a problem), and push forward.

One of the first things the material advised me to do was to take breaks. Often times the solution to a problem is right in front of you but you only figure it out once you've spent some time away from the computer. I've found this to be very true just a few months into my development. I would recommend to anyone starting out to take frequent breaks by stretching, going for a walk, and my personal favorite: taking a nap. There are countless studies as to the benefits of sleep to allow the mind to take new material and reorganize it.

Finally, getting stuck will happen. Learning to code is a roller coaster of highs and lows. There are times when I am on a roll and feel like the smartest man alive and there are times when I think I'll never understand a concept or how to just get the computer to do what I want. These are the times when you have to take a deep breath and decide to take a break or allow yourself to struggle with the material. Often times when I've allowed my brain to stew for what feels like an eternity over a problem are when I feel best about myself productively. It's incredibly rewarding to know you put a lot of thought into something and overcame it on your own. That being said, everyone needs help. This has been one of my biggest challenges: telling myself I'm not stupid or a bother if I have to reach out to my mentor or fellow students with questions. After doing so I've found greater peace of mind; reaching out to fellow developers helps me be a part of a larger community and express myself.
