title: In Defense of "The Last Jedi"
---

Star Wars is at it's best when it shows you something new.
When Obi-Wan disappeared out of thin air.
"You're all clear, kid! Now let's blow this thing and go home!"
When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan fought Darth Maul.

And now I know Luke became powerful enough to transfer his consciousness across the universe when his friends and family needed him most.

"The Last Jedi" reminded us throughout that it owed us no answers.

Reys parents are nobodies. Or Kylo is lying.
We may never know if Snoke had a separate identity somehow connected to the previous trilogies.

Not getting everything you want or expect out of a movie is not inherently bad.

Characters developed throughout "The Last Jedi".
Finn may be the only person Rey can ever call family after working
together to get off Jakku.

Finn learns he cannot separate himself from the galactic conflict.

Luke learns he has to forgive himself.

Rey faces the fact that she may never find her parents.

That was my takeaway,

Thanks for reading!
