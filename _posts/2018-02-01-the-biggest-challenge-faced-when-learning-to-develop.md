title: The Biggest Challenge I've Faced when Learning to Develop
---
The biggest challenge I've faced when learning to develop has been being too hard on myself. I have learned:

* Learning to code well takes time.
* Remember to take breaks.
* You will get stuck.

Early on my mentor, recognized during our 1-on-1 sessions throughout each week that I was beating myself up. She compared learning coding to learning a new language; the brain has to form new neurological pathways to comprehend what it's seeing. That takes time and practice. Learning by writing down questions has become an indispensable skill throughout the process.

Anyone who codes will tell you to take breaks by stretching, going for a walk, and my personal favorite: taking a nap. Countless times I was frustrated over a problem only to come back from a break and immediately see a solution.

Learning to code is a roller coaster of highs and lows. There are times when I am on a roll and feel like the smartest man alive and there are times when I think I'll never  get the computer to do what I want. Reaching out for help is key when you've exhausted all other options so you can keep pushing forward.
