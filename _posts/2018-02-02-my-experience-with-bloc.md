title: My Experience with Bloc
---
My experience with Bloc began April 10th, 2016. I can hardly believe the vast amounts of skills I've learned during that time. In 9 months I have learned frontend and backend fundamentals and made numerous projects and deployed them.

* HTML   
* CSS   
* JavaScript   
* DOM Scripting   
* jQuery   
* Angular
* A music listening application
* A chat room application
* A self-destructing to-do list application
* A topic and discussion application
* A landmark-tagging API application
* as well as this portfolio!

Bloc is well structured with checkpoints that most often can be completed in one sitting. You can always see what percentage complete you are in the curriculum compared to where you should be.

There are multiple "paces" to fit any student's schedule and accommodate their work/life balance.

The option to "freeze" your program for a week allows students to not fall behind if life events get in the way of. This helped me when I discovered the negative effects of a poor ergonomic work-station and had to take a week to nurse lower back, shoulder and neck pain/spasms on top of internet issues for a week (thanks CableOne).

1-on-1 mentor sessions have keep me motivated to stay on shedule and do work that my mentor and I can be proud of. Mentors are truly invested in my success and believe in the program.

And for those (like me) worried about taking an online course and not having a community of students and teachers you would get from a traditional classroom education, fear not! Slack saves the day. I've met several helpful and enthusiastic students and mentors that are available at all hours of the day and night to discuss a range of topics or just chat about the news of the day.
