title: Junior Developer Goals
---
My goals as a developer are threefold:

* Do work I can be proud of
* Never stop learning
* Leave the world better than you left it

I've always asked myself questions such as:

**How does that work?*

**How could a language be comprised so as to solve everyday problems?*

**I've always been curious.*


After almost a year of learning software languages, JavaScript and Ruby, as well as their corresponding frameworks, AngularJS and Rails, I now ask myself:

**How do I use conditionals and loops to retrieve the data I need?*

**How do I write each step in pseudocode?*

**What are the questions I need to be asking myself?*


Everyday growing my career as a software developer excites me because I am passionate to continue learning and finding answers.
