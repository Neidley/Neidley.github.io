This belongs to [Andrew Anderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-anderson-63b264131/), [Steven D. Riley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-riley-ab32661b/), and [myself](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewneidley/).

If I learned one thing from winning the Grand Prize at the first Hackathon I ever attended, it is this:

_If you can't create a front-end or back-end website/app yet in a short period of time,_

_scratch and claw to get a front-end and back-end developer in your team._

I was lucky enough to meet Andrew through my bootcamp, a wiz with Angular 6+ and my software mentor. As luck would have it, he moved to Austin in the same week as becoming my mentor. Austin is my dream-job location. What great luck!

We met Steven at the Hackathon, a recent Bootcamp grad and Cloud Solution Engineer at Oracle willing to implement back-end Express/MySQL for our idea.

Which reminds me the second most important lesson for hackathon first-timers:

_You better bring the best idea ever._

_That means put some work into the idea. Bring some notes. If you can't talk about it, you don't know it well enough._

Here was our idea:

_Learn With Me offers coding-mentorship-as-a-service, curating the litany of fragmented coding resources into a comprehensive curriculum complete with one-on-one coaching at the fraction of the cost of traditional coding schools._

A third realization through this experience:

## _I have so much more I need to learn!!!_

Don't let that keep you from attending a hackathon. You will struggle, but you will undoubtedly have something worthwile to contribute to a team if you prepare prior to attending the hackathon. Take the leap.

Ask all the questions, be polite, smile,

and introduce yourself to anyone who can help you or who you can help.

### _We now as a team have the support of AngelHack and their HackCelerator startup curriculum over the next 12 weeks for a chance to present to top investors in_

San Francisco. I hope everyone gets a win when they need one just like I did through this experience.
