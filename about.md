I decided to take the opportunity to learn Full-Stack Software Development through an online bootcamp called Bloc. I chose to learn the skills to start a new career outside of retail because I love technology, learning, creating, and analytical thinking. My past success in leadership positions around customers gives me unique communication insight to any team developing software.

So far through the help of the Bloc program, I have created

* a Spotify app, a messaging app, a wiki app,
* a Reddit app, and
* a Self Destructing To-Do list app.

Most recently using **Googleâ€™s Vision API**,

I created an app called BackStory Tour that allows users to save images of landmarks and provides a link to Wikipedia. [BackStory Tour](https://backstory-tour.herokuapp.com/users/sign_up)

I am passionate about continuing my software engineering education, as well as my wife and our two dogs.
