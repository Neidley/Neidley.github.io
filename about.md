I learn and create something new and feed my natural curiosity everyday I code.

13 projects in the 18 months,<br/>
over 75 hours pair-programming with senior developers,<br/>
and numerous open-source source contributions later,<br/>
I have gained an appreciation for the solid understanding<br/> of software engineering principles that I have gained along the way.

From Googleâ€™s Vision API to Amazon Web Services S3 buckets, I'm fascinated by all the amazing tools being created and updated everyday in the world of software.

I look forward to finding a permanent developer team in Austin, TX that shares my passion for clean and thoughtful code, and having fun learning together and teaching eachother.
