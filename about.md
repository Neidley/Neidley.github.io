I left retail to learn Full-Stack Software Development because
I love learning, creating, and analytical thinking.

My past experiences managing a team gave me the invaluable skills of
how to create action plans, identify successful behaviors, and the importance of celebrating small successes everyday.

Everyday I code, I get to learn and create something new everyday and feed my natural curiosity.

I have created 9 projects in the last 9 months since I began this journey.

Most recently using **Googleâ€™s Vision API** and **Amazon Web Services**, I created an app called Landmark Discoveries that allows users to identify and save images of landmarks and provides a link to Wikipedia. [Landmark Discoveries](https://landmark-discoveries.herokuapp.com/users/sign_up)

I am passionate about continuing to grow into a better developer everyday.

And I couldn't do it without the support of my wife and our two dogs.
