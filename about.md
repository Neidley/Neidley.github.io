I left retail to learn Full-Stack Software Development full-time. I love learning, creating, and analytical thinking. Everyday I code I learn something new or a better way to accomplish a task. Being a developer allows me to create something new everyday. I know from past experience as a manager I will be an exceptional addition to any team.

Being a manager taught me that everyone's voice is crucial for the team to succeed, have fun
at work, and be open to failure.


I have created 9 projects in the last 9 months since I began this journey.
Most recently using **Googleâ€™s Vision API**, I created an app called Landmark Discoveries that allows users to save images of landmarks and provides a link to Wikipedia. [Landmark Discoveries](https://landmark-discoveries.herokuapp.com/users/sign_up)

I am passionate about continuing to grow into a better developer everyday.
And I couldn't do it without the support of my wife and our two dogs.
